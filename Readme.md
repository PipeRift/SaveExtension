Save Extension allows your projects to be saved and loaded.

This plugin is for Unreal Engine 4 and actively supports the last 2 versions of the engine.

## Introduction

At Piperift we like to release the technology we create for ourselves.

Save Extension is part of this technology, and as such, we wanted it to be public so that others can enjoy it too, making the job of the developer considerably easier.

This plugin was designed to fulfill the needs for automatic world saving and loading that are unfortunately missing in the engine at this moment in time. Automatic in the sense that any actor in the world can be saved, including AI, Players, controllers or game logic without any extra components or setups.

## Intended Usage

All our technology is designed to work for very different games and needs, but, naturally, it was created around certain requirements.

In the case of SaveExtension, it has been developed to support games with high amounts of content in the world like open worlds or narrative games.

What I mean by this is that you usually wouldn't serialize a world for a mario game. It can do it, but may not be worth it. Other games might have items to be picked, player states, AI, or streaming levels that require this serialization and here's where the strength of SaveExtension comes.
