# Actor Settings

---

Each actor blueprint can have its own configuration which is edited directly inside the blueprint:
![Open actor settings](./img/actor_settings.png ':size=450')

This settings get translated into actor tags so they can also be added in C++.

- **Tags**: Should save actor tags?
- **Transform**: Should save position, rotation and scale of this actor?
  - **Physics**: Should physics be saved? **Transform** is required to be enabled to save physics.

!> If you can't see *"Save Settings"* window opened it can be manually opened from **Window -> Save Settings**<br>
